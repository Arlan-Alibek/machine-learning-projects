    "Categorical variables describe the characteristics of the object. For instance `brand` of the car.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "We can use categorical variables in machine learning models in different ways. One of the simplest approaches is to encode such variables using a set of binary features, with a separate feature for each distinct value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will create three binary features: `num_doors_2`, `num_doors_3`, and `num_doors_4`. If a car has two doors, then `num_doors_2` will be set to 1 and the others to 0. If a car has three doors, then `num_doors_3` will have the value 1, and the same logic applies to `num_doors_4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method of encoding categorical variables is called **one-hot encoding**.\n",

    "We will apply the same logic for `make` of the car, `engine_fuel_type`, `transmission_type`,`driven_wheels`, `market_category`,`vehicle_size`, `vehicle_style` after we check how `num_of_doors` and `make` affect the **RSME**"
