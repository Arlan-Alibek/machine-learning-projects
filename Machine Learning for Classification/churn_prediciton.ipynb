    "**Churn** is a phenomenon where customers stop using the services of a company. Therefore, churn prediction involves identifying customers who are most likely to terminate their contracts in the near future. If a company can do this, it can offer discounts or special deals on its services in order to retain those customers.\n",

This is a **binary classification** task. The target variable we want to predict is categorical and has only two possible outcomes: **will leave** or **will not leave**.\n"
